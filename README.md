# Hi, I'm Gustavo, but you can call me Gus #

I'm currently a Web UI Developer, currently based in Buenos Aires, Argentina 🇦🇷. I am now two years into a full-time career as a developer, yet I feel as if I had just started!. I'm currently learning React and NodeJS, Typescript and Ruby On Rails. I also have delved into DevOps, specializing in CI/CD implementation and management, as well as for deployment in cloud providers :cloud:. 

Argentine 🇦🇷 / israeli 🇮🇱, he/ him, jew/ halfway atheist. 

Suggestions, code reviews, donations 🙏 and dark humor jokes are always welcome.
